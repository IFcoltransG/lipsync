# Lipsync

Lipsync is a Lisp-like logical language allowing overloads, loaded with a type system, and which performs some inference.

Syntactically, it has brackets, colons, and dots. I expect I will also add the staples of quotes, unquotes, quasiquotes and so on.

## Usage

Currently nothing works. I suggest you refrain from usage.
